### Staticit - Introduction

Whether you want to increase performance of your web application or improve SEO. Generally you have 2 options, use **SSR** (Server Side Rendering) or **SSG** (Static Site Generation). SSR can be cumbersome and you will need a server to host it.

SSG is relatively simple and a good alternative. Some frameworks have this feature out of the box some don't, some are bloated and you may want a simpler solution. **Here comes the Staticit!**

Staticit is a improved version of a small library called [react-spa-prerender](https://github.com/sPavl0v/react-spa-prenderer). Under the hood it uses [sifrr](https://sifrr.github.io/sifrr/#/) and [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to generate static files.

Since it's standalone it will work with any build tool and any front-end framework that supports routing.

> How it works?

- Serves the web application from build directory with **sifrr**.
- Renders & generates desired routes with **puppeteer**.
- Reformats all generated HTML files with **prettier** so they'll be pretty ðŸ¥°.

#

### Install

> <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/engineerhub-static/exclamation-yellow.png" height="15" width="auto" /> - Latest **LTS Node.js** is recommended.

- With npm:

```sh
$ npm install -D staticit
```

- With yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add --dev staticit
```

- With pnpm:

```sh
$ pnpm install -D staticit
```

#

### Usage

Create a file called [`.staticit.json`](.staticit.json) in your project root directory. For minimal configuration add the following lines.

```json
{
  "routes": ["/", "/about"],
  "outDir": "./dist",
  "port": 8080
}
```

> <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/engineerhub-static/exclamation-yellow.png" height="15" width="auto" /> - If you are going to build your application in an automated environment, for example with a CI tool. You should pass the `--no-sandbox` flag to `puppeteer: launchOpts` or you might get errors since most of them are running inside of a container with root user. [(Ref)](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#setting-up-chrome-linux-sandbox)

- Then add a postbuild step to your [`package.json`](package.json).

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "postbuild": "staticit"
}
```
