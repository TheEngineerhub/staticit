### Staticit - Introduction

Whether you want to increase performance or improve SEO of your web application. You have generally 2 options, use **SSR** (Server Side Rendering) or **SSG** (Static Site Generation). SSR can be cumbersome and you will need an actual server with lots of configurations depending of your application.

SSG is relatively simple and a good alternative. Some frameworks has this feature out of the box some are not, some are bloat and you will want a simpler solution. **Here comes the Staticit!**.

Staticit is a improved version of a small library called [react-spa-prerender](https://github.com/sPavl0v/react-spa-prenderer). Under the hood it uses [sifrr](https://sifrr.github.io/sifrr/#/) and [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to generate static files.

It will work with any build tool since it's independent and with any frontend framework that supports routing.

> How it works?

- Serves the web application from build directory with **sifrr**.
- Renders desired routes with **puppeteer**.
- Reformats all generated HTML files with **prettier** so they'll be pretty ðŸ¥°.

#

### Install

- With npm:

```sh
$ npm install -D staticit
```

- With yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add --dev staticit
```

- With pnpm:

```sh
$ pnpm install -D staticit
```

#

### Usage

Create a file called [`.staticit.json`](.staticit.json) in your projects root directory. For minimal configuration add the following lines.

```json
{
  "routes": ["/", "/about"],
  "outDir": "./dist",
  "port": 8080,
  "puppeteer": {
    "launchOpts": {
      "args": ["--no-sandbox"]
    }
  }
}
```

You should pass the `--no-sandbox` flag to `puppeteer: launchOpts.` or you might get errors since most of them are running inside of a container with root user.
